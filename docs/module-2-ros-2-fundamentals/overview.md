## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
1. Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
2. Design and implement ROS 2 nodes for robot communication
3. Create and use topics, services, and actions for different communication needs
4. Implement distributed systems with proper message passing between components
5. Debug and optimize ROS 2 communication in robotic systems
6. Apply ROS 2 best practices to coordinate complex humanoid robot subsystems

## Introduction

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) serves as the middleware that enables communication between different components of a robotic system. For humanoid robots with multiple sensors, actuators, and control systems, ROS 2 provides the essential infrastructure for coordination, message passing, and distributed computing.

This module covers the foundational concepts of ROS 2, including its architecture, communication patterns (topics, services, actions), and practical implementation for coordinating components of a humanoid robotic system. Students will learn how to leverage ROS 2 to build reliable, maintainable robotic software systems.

## Module Structure

- Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture and Middleware
- Chapter 2: Topics and Asynchronous Communication

## Prerequisites

Students should have:
- Basic programming skills in Python or C++
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic understanding of distributed systems concepts

## Duration

This module is designed to be completed in 3-4 weeks with approximately 8-10 hours of study per week.

## Assessment

Students will be assessed through:
- Weekly quizzes to test theoretical understanding
