## Course Overview

This textbook is organized into four main modules:

1. **Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Understanding the middleware that connects all components of a robotic system
2. **Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: Simulation environments for testing and development
3. **AI Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**: Machine learning and artificial intelligence for robotic perception and control
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Multimodal AI systems for real-world interaction

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:

- Understand the architecture of modern humanoid robotic systems
- Be proficient in ROS 2 for robotic communication and control
- Know how to simulate, test, and validate robotic systems in digital environments
- Be able to implement AI algorithms for perception, planning, and control
- Understand Vision-Language-Action models for multimodal robotic interaction

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to learn about the foundational communication layer that makes all robotic systems possible.
