After completing this module, students will be able to:
1. Explain the principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
2. Differentiate between traditional AI approaches and embodied cognition
3. Implement basic control algorithms for robotic systems
4. Analyze complex robotic tasks using embodied intelligence principles
5. Design appropriate solutions for physical AI challenges

## Introduction

This module introduces the foundational concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence that form the basis of humanoid robotics. Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI approaches by considering the physical embodiment of intelligent systems as an integral part of their intelligence, rather than as a separate component that simply executes commands from a disembodied "brain."

Embodied intelligence emphasizes the role of the body in cognition, suggesting that physical interactions with the environment are essential to the development of intelligent behavior. This perspective has profound implications for robotics, particularly for humanoid robots that must navigate and interact with the physical world in ways that mirror human experience.

The module will cover the theoretical foundations of embodied intelligence, the mathematical principles underlying control theory, and practical applications of these concepts in robotics. Students will learn how to apply these principles to develop more effective and natural robotic systems.
