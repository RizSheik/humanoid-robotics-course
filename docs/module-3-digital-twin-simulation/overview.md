## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
1. Understand the principles and applications of digital twin technology in robotics
2. Implement and configure simulation environments using Gazebo, Unity, and Isaac Sim
3. Develop accurate physics-based models of robotic systems for simulation
4. Transfer learned behaviors from simulation to real hardware with minimal performance degradation
5. Design and implement simulation-to-reality transfer methodologies
6. Evaluate and optimize simulation environments for specific robotic applications

## Introduction

Digital twin technology creates virtual replicas of physical systems that can be used for testing, validation, and optimization. In robotics, digital twins enable safe, cost-effective development and testing of complex robotic systems before deployment on expensive hardware. This module covers three major simulation platforms: Gazebo for physics-based simulation, Unity for visualization-rich environments, and Isaac Sim for AI-powered robotics simulation.

The module emphasizes the critical challenge of sim-to-real transfer, ensuring that behaviors learned in simulation can effectively translate to real-world robotic systems. Students will learn to create accurate simulation models and develop techniques to minimize the reality gap between simulation and real-world performance.
